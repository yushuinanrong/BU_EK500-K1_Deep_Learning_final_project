# BU_EK500-K1_Deep_Learning_final_project
This repository includes the source code of the final project "Single Image Super-Resolution Using GAN" created by Jiawei Chen &amp; Jinyuan Zhao

Usage:
1. Install tensorflow and sugartensor wrapper
2. Download the CIFAR-10 dataset (MATLAB version) and extract it into a folder "cifar-10"
3. Create a folder "Dataset"
4. Run preprocess_cifar10.m for data preprocessing
5. Run train.py to train the GAN
6. Run generate.py to generate output images for test samples

You can modify train.py and generate.py to make them work on the MNIST or CIFAR-10 dataset
